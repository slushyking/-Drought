# Drought

**What is drought?**

Drought is a prolonged period of abnormally low rainfall, leading to a shortage of water. Drought almost always comes with extremely hot and/or dry weather. This can end up being detrimental to the animals or plants living in the area experiencing drought. Animals or plants adapted to living in areas not used to dry weather may not be able to thrive once the drought hits. They may die of lack of water or from too much heat. Not only are plants and animals affected, humans are also affected. People without access to fresh water normally will have even less access to fresh drinking water during the drought.

**Where does it happen?**

Droughts can happen anywhere in the world, although usually in already hot and dry areas. Common places that experience drought include the American Southwest, more specifically the states of California, Nevada, Utah and Arizona. These states are experiencing unprecedented levels of heat and dryness. Other countires with high risk of drought includ Moldova, Ukraine, Bangladesh, India, and Serbia. Drought can happen very erraticaally, sometimes appearing in areas that haven't had drought for a long time. In addcttion, droughts can last from weeks or months to entire decades. Although it may seems strange, droughts can happen in generally wet areas such as rainforests or jungles. These have occured recently in areas like the Amazon Rainforest, Africa, and Asia. One famous occurence of major dorought was the Dust Bowl, which happened in the 1930s and affected millions of farmers across America.

**Why does drought happen?**

Droughts are a natural occurence caused by things like ocean temperatures, changes in the jet stream, and changes in the local landscape. Scientists think that drought is directly affected by human-caused global warming. Carbon emmisions from human activity have cause the planet to warm up, meaning less rain falls in certain areas. Although climate change affects droughts, it doesn't actually cause them. Droughts have been occuring since forever, and have only recently gotten worse, most probably from climate change. 

**How can we help with drought?**

Drought can be helped through many ways. One such way is using water efficiently. Sometimes when you use water you may unintentionally use too much. Some examples of things you can do in everyday life that can help with conserving water is using lessing water in the shower, when you brush your teeth, and when you wash your hands. Approximately 9% of all water in the U.S. is lost through leaks, so making sure your pipes and appliances aren't leaking can be a huge help. All in all, focusing on saving water is a sure way to help with the issue of drought.
