# Drought

**What is drought?**

Drought is a prolonged period of abnormally low rainfall, leading to a shortage of water. Drought almost always comes with extremely hot and/or dry weather. This can end up being detrimental to the animals or plants living in the area experiencing drought.

**Where does it happen?**

Common places that experience drought include the American Southwest, more specifically the states of California, Nevada, Utah and Arizona. These states are experiencing unprecedented levels of heat and dryness.

**Why does drought happen?**

Scientists think that drought is directly affected by human-caused global warming. Carbon emmisions from human activity have cause the planet to warm up, meaning less rain falls in certain areas.
